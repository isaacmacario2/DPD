# Introduction
This repository is intended for the implementation of a Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) for compensation of non-linearities, inserted by a power amplifier (PA), with several types of adaptive filtering algorithms.

The DPDs of this repository follow the Indirect Learning Architecture (ILA) model, as shown in the figure below.

In this repository, two codes for pre-distortion were made, the first is simulation.m, which uses a database of the NXP Airfast LDMOS Doherty PA power amplifier provided by Math Works at https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/power-amplifier-characterization.html. The second code is made with real data from the Cree CGH40006-TB amplifier, remotely, through the website https://dpdcompetition.com/rfweblab/.

To carry out the second code, the following structure is used:
